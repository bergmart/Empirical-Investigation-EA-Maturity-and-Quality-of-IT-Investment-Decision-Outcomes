# Empirical-Investigation-EA-Maturity-and-Quality-of-IT-Investment-Decision-Outcomes
Companion repository for a study in which the relationship between Enterprise Architecture Maturity and the Quality of IT Investment Decision Outcomes was researched. This study is submitted to Information Systems and e-Business Management (November 2020).

The study was designed, developed, and reported by the following researchers: Martin van den Berg (HU University of Applied Sciences), Raymond Slot (Strategy Alliance), Marlies van Steenbergen (HU University of Applied Sciences), Guido Ongena (HU University of Applied Sciences), Peter Faasse (Dataska), Hans van Vliet (Vrije Universiteit).

One of the expected contributions of enterprise architecture (EA) is improved decision-making. The IT investment decision is one of the decisions that is assumed to benefit from EA. However, there is no clear evidence of any relationship between EA and the quality of IT investment decisions. The objective of this research is to empirically study the relationship between the maturity of an EA practice, the quality of IT investment decisions, and the quality of the outcomes of IT investment decisions. A quantitative research approach was chosen, in which data were collected from a survey of 142 EA developers, users, and implementers. The main finding from this study is that the maturity of an EA practice has a weak positive relationship with the quality of IT investment decision outcomes, where this relationship is fully mediated by the quality of IT investment decisions. Our study indicates that enterprise architects should focus on ways to improve the quality of IT investment decisions rather than the quality of the outcomes of these decisions.
